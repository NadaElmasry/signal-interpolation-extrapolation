# signal-interpolation-extrapolation


- Curve interpolation and extrapolation using the number of chunks and polynomial degrees chosen by the user with a graphical representation of the error.
- Error map used to pick the perfect number of chunks, degree of polynomial or percentage of overlap.
This done by showing the percentage of error in 2D map, the 2-axis are chosen by the user from a drop-down menu containing number of chunks, degree of polynomial or percentage of overlap.
